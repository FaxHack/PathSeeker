- **Base Finder**  
  Uncover hidden bases and dungeons effortlessly, giving you the edge in anarchy gameplay.

- **Pitch40Util**
  Used alongside Meteor's pitch 40. Auto sets min and max bounds so that you continue to gain height. It also has an
  auto firework mode for when you lose
  velocity. [Jeff-Mod](https://github.com/miles352/meteor-stashhunting-addon/blob/1.21.1/src/main/java/com/stash/hunt/modules/Pitch40Util.java)

- **TrailFollower** (Requires XaeroPlus)
  Follows trails in all dimensions using either pitch40 or baritone. It may break on path splits or other
  cases. [Jeff-Mod](https://github.com/miles352/meteor-stashhunting-addon/blob/1.21.1/src/main/java/com/stash/hunt/modules/TrailFollower.java)

- **AutoEnchanter:** Automates enchanting at anvils, saving time and effort.

- **GrimEfly:** Vanilla efly uses a chest-plate to ensure that elytra do not consume
  durability. [Jeff-Mod](https://github.com/miles352/meteor-stashhunting-addon/blob/1.21.1/src/main/java/com/stash/hunt/modules/GrimEfly.java)

> Make sure your predefined item lists are accurate. Incorrect configurations may result in missing valuable loot.

- **GrimDuraFirework**  
  A clever fix for fireworks issues on the Mio client when using Grim Durability ElytraFly with a chestplate. Fly
  smoothly without a
  hitch! [Credits to meteor-mod](https://github.com/miles352/meteor-stashhunting-addon/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/addon/modules/GrimDuraFirework.java)

  Records & restores broken or modified
  signs. [Credits to Stardust](https://github.com/0xTas/stardust/blob/64cd499c62d30be8e479b084a613e0c05b77c8d9/src/main/java/dev/stardust/modules/SignHistorian.java)

- **NewerNewChunks**  
  Take control of chunk tracing! Manage chunk data across servers and dimensions with crash-resilient saving, easy
  sharing options, and pinpoint accuracy.

> To share your chunk data with friends, copy the `PathSeeker/NewChunks` folder and send it directly.

- **Hole/Tunnel/StairsESP**  
  Spot 1x1 holes, horizontal tunnels, and staircase tunnels like a pro. By default, it skips passable blocks like
  torches or water but can be configured to detect only air. (Credits to Meteor Client and etianl)

- **PotESP**  
  Detect Decorated Pots with unnatural contents and find out what's inside! Easily locate suspicious pots in your
  environment. [Credits to etianl](https://github.com/etianl/Trouser-Streak/blob/1.21.1/src/main/java/pwn/noobs/trouserstreak/modules/PotESP.java)

- **PortalPatternFinder**  
  Scan for shapes of broken or removed Nether Portals within cave air blocks. Great for tracking portal skips in the
  Nether for 1.13+
  chunks. [Credits to etianl](https://github.com/etianl/Trouser-Streak/blob/1.21.1/src/main/java/pwn/noobs/trouserstreak/modules/PortalPatternFinder.java)

> [!NOTE]  
> PortalPatternFinder works best when paired with advanced chunk detection tools.

- **CaveDisturbanceDetector**  
  Hunt for single air blocks hidden within cave air, helping you identify disturbances in 1.13+ underground
  structures. [Credits to etianl](https://github.com/etianl/Trouser-Streak/blob/1.21.1/src/main/java/pwn/noobs/trouserstreak/modules/PortalPatternFinder.java)

> [!CAUTION]
